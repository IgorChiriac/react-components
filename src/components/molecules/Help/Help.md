### Summary

If used, `<Help />` should sit ontop of [`<ZopaFooter />`](/#/Components/Molecules/ZopaFooter).

Its aim is to give the customer information about Zopa's customer service opening hours and phone numbers to call about specific products.

### Example

```tsx
import { Help } from '@zopauk/react-components';

<Help email="savings@zopa.com" />;
```
