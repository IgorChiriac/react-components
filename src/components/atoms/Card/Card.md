The design team has agreed on two variations of cards depending on the context:

#### Default variant

A standard or default card, which we'll assume if the type property has been omitted or set explicitly to card. As of this writing, cards of this type are non-interactable and have a border radius of 4px.

```js { "props": { "style": { "backgroundColor": "#141E64" } } }
import { Card, Text } from '@zopauk/react-components';

<Card type="card">
  <Text as="p">I'm a card ðŸ˜€ , with an explicit type prop.</Text>
</Card>;
```

#### Link variant

A card that is meant to be clickable and respond to user interactions (hover effects et al). Border radius of 8px. Note that any additional **styles and effects are meant to be added separately** by using this component as a base on which to build another with the desired effects.

Cards of type `"linkCard"` are meant to be used to build components that interact with user actions.

```js { "props": { "style": { "backgroundColor": "#141E64" } } }
import { Card, Text, Heading } from '@zopauk/react-components';

<Card type="linkCard" onClick={() => alert("You're a winner!")}>
  <Heading as="h3">New rates today! ðŸ’¸</Heading>
  <Text as="p">Find out how you can benefit the most from our new rates.</Text>
</Card>;
```
