### Summary

Use `<Spinner />` whenever we need to notify the user that something is loading.

⚠️ &nbsp; We're working with the design team to settle on a single variation. When using it please don't customise it and stick to the styles and colors shown in the example.

### Example

```ts
import { colors, Spinner } from '@zopauk/react-components';

<Spinner size="100px" borderWidth="16px" />;
```
