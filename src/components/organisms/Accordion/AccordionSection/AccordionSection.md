### Summary

<Accordion.Section /> is a simple block element that passes down its `ref` to its children.
In this way, we can allow the section to be collapsible.

- It's meant to be used along `<Accordion.Section>` and `useAccordion`.
- [`<Accordion />`](/#/Components/Organisms/Accordion) examples for how they're all meant to play together.
