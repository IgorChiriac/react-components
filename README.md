Shared react styled components for all the Zopa projects.

This repo contains 2 things at the same time:

- The Typescript library for the react components

- Documentation for the components managed with [React-styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org)

[Check the docs üíï](https://zopauk.github.io/react-components/)

### Motivation

The aim of this project is to share with the frontend community how we code in Zopa.

We think it might be useful for someone who wants to start a new react components library and want to re-use some of our code.
