## Documentation ‚úçÔ∏è

Helping people with issues or writing docs are definitely the best ways to get started with this project.

## Tracking progress üìà

For this repo we are use a mix of Github issues and a private JIRA board (only accessible to Zopa employees).

A ticket or issue reference must be attached in the description of any pull request.

Please help reviewers by documenting you PR extensively with screenshots and the rationale behind it.

## Project Structure üéí

Components should live in `src/components`, their own folder and contain the following files:

```
src/
  components/
    Button/
      Button.md
      Button.tsx
      Button.test.tsx
```

- [x] Markdown file (`Button.md`, documents the component)
- [x] Component file (`Button.tsx`)
- [x] Unit tests file ( `Button.test.tsx`)

Please follow the same code structure within the file found in the rest of the project.

Once your component it's ready, expose it in `src/index.ts` by adding:

```ts
export { default as Button } from './components/Button/Button';
```

## Release process üöÄ

The conventional commits standard allows us to automate package releases.

[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) is the tool we are using for automatically releases, doing the following steps:

| Step                  | Description                                                                                                                     |

## Beta releases üçâ

### Conventions

üëçüèª &nbsp;Please use **beta releases with care and mostly for**:

- [x] getting feedback on major versions before releasing them
- [x] getting feedback on APIs for new features

üëéüèª &nbsp;Don't use beta releases for testing patches/fixes on this library

We rely on a manual process for releasing beta versions of this library ( _this could be automated in a near future..._ ).

We use the following naming convention for **beta releases**:

```js
`${upcomingVersion}--beta.${currentBetaIteration}`;
```

For instance, `4.0.0--beta.4` translates to the **4th beta iteration** of the next major version `4.0.0`.

### Process

To release a beta iteration of your upcoming version:

1. Let's update the version of the library:

```
# assuming we're in 3.8.0
$ yarn version --new-version 4.0.0--beta.1
```

2. Let's compile the source code

```
# this should create the /es /types and /cjs directories on the project root
$ yarn compile
```

3. Let's push our changes so we can tie this beta release to a point in the Git history:

```
# always do a beta release from a feature branch, never from master!
$ git push origin milestone/4.0.0
```

4. Let's publish the package on NPM on the `next` tag (the one we use to publish betas):

```
# if you're not part of Zopa NPM organization you'll need to request access to be able to publish
$ npm publish --tag next
```

5. Now clients of this library can try the beta release doing:

```
$ yarn add @zopauk/react-components@next
```
